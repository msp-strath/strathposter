# Strathclyde Poster

A template for creating posters in LaTeX,
together with an opinionated style for strathclyde.

The opinionated style need not be used...

The underlying class is

https://github.com/anriseth/baposter/

which provides a simply customisable poster class.
Baposter supports:

+ nice heading and box styles;
+ more finegrained positioning and column specification;
+ simple box styling;


Beamerposter and tikzposter are alternatives; baposter is the one I have used.
All seem to be stagnating/dormant.
YMMV.

Improvements can, of course be made.

PRs mostly welcome.
